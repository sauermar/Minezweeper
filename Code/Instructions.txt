You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs),
others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you 
manage to flag all the squares with mines (without clicking on any) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring 
squares containing bombs. 
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. 
To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click.

A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, 
and all 4 diagonals.
If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will 
automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.
If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before 
you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to
 mistakes which do.

Left-click the yellow face to start a new game. Right-click it if
